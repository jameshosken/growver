# Growver
## A.K.A Power Plant v2
The Growver is a solar-powered rover with plants attached, that intermittently seeks out the optimal light conditions for its plants.

## Hardware
The Growver is built using:
- Arduino Uno
- Adafruit MotorShield v2
- Improved astable 555 timing circuit with a relay
  - This timing circuit controls the power to the rest of the circuit, helping us keep our power budget low.


## Software
All code for the Growver runs on an Arduino Uno, and can be found in this repo.
